Denholm - Independent Chairwoman\\nUnknown Executive -\\nAnalysts\\nPresentation\\nMartin Viecha\\nGood afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Tesla\\'s 2023 Annual Shareholder Meeting in Austin, Texas. My name is Martin\\nViecha. I\\'m Vice President of Investor Relations, and I will be the chair of today\\'s meeting.\\nFirst of all, I really wanted to thank everyone who continues to do this trip on annual basis and shows up every time. It\\'s really\\nquite something that we have a following as dedicated as this. So thank you very much for that.\\nI also wanted to thank our first-time visitors. I know that many of you won a lottery to come for the first time to Tesla shareholder\\nmeeting.\\nYou\\'ll probably notice that unlike many other shareholder meetings of other companies, this one tends to be a bit more fun. So I\\nhope you enjoy that.\\nBut the last thing I really wanted to say is that just thank you so much for all your support over the years. We really feel like\\nyou\\'re part of our mission, part of our story, and it\\'s something we truly, truly value. So thank you so much for that.\\nThere will be 2 parts of today\\'s meeting. First, the formal part of the meeting, where we will cover items that stockholders have\\nbeen asked to vote on as well as any other matters that are properly presented. And after the voting, I will introduce Tesla\\'s\\nCo-Founder and CEO, and Technoking, Elon Musk, who will give a presentation about Tesla\\'s year-in-review. But at this time, I\\'d\\nlike to thank the members of the Tesla team and the Board who are here with us here today. Representative from\\nPricewaterhouseCoopers, Tesla\\'s independent auditor, present with us as well.\\nBut before we begin, I\\'d like to introduce you to Tesla\\'s Chair, Robyn Denholm, who would like to say a few words.\\nRobyn M. Denholm\\nI\\'m a little bit shorter. So hello, everyone. On behalf of the Board, I am really honored to welcome you all here today to the 2023\\nAnnual Shareholder Meeting. It\\'s wonderful for me to see everyone in the room today and also the many investors that have\\njoined us today via the virtual live stream.\\nIt\\'s our third straight year of having the annual meeting here in Austin. At the first meeting, the factory was still in the early stages\\nof development with equipment being installed and commissioned. During the 2022 meeting, production has started to ramp as\\nwe produced about 1,600 vehicles that week. And now less than a year later, we have more than tripled the amount, having\\nachieved production of 5,000 cars in a single week. A huge congratulation to the Texas team.\\nAnd on top of that, we are getting ready to roll out our first Cybertrucks. This exponential trajectory of the Gigafactory here in\\nTexas is a reflection of Tesla as a whole. In 2022, was another record-breaking year for us, with deliveries growing by 40%\\nyear-over-year, and that trend has continued in the first quarter of 2023.Tesla, Inc. - Shareholder/Analyst Call\\nTesla, Inc. | Event Detail\\nLicensed to martin.thomasmathews@ihsmarkit.com Powered by S&P Global | Page 2 of 20We would not be able to achieve this growth without the dedication of our amazing employees. I\\'ve been fortunate enough over\\nthe years to actually travel to many of our locations, all of the Gigafactories around the world. And I can tell you that I\\'ve\\nwitnessed firsthand how our exceptional employees in our global talent across the world has together achieved our mission or\\nfurthered our mission of accelerating the world\\'s transition to sustainable energy.\\nA huge round of applause, please. This year, here in Texas, we also had our very first Investor Day, where we introduced our\\ncompany leaders from design to engineering, to supply chain, manufacturing, energy and charging. And they each spoke about\\nthe role of their teams in making our mission come to life. And I was thrilled that investors were able to hear directly from this\\noutstanding leadership team that Elon has been able to put together over many, many years. It is on the strength of their\\nleadership and the hard work of our dedicated employees around the world that I believe we are not only weather the\\nmacroeconomic environment that we\\'ve seen this year, but also continue to be in the strongest position ever to advance Tesla\\'s\\nmission.\\nAs a start-up, Tesla proved that electric vehicles could be fun with the Roadster. They could even be better than gas-powered\\nvehicles in every single way with the S and X and could be all of these things as well as affordable with the Model 3 and Model\\nY, which last quarter became the best-selling vehicle of any kind in Europe and the best-selling non-pickup vehicle in the United\\nStates.\\nAnd today, as one of the world\\'s largest global companies, we plan to change the paradigm again by forging the path to\\nachieving a global sustainable energy economy as set out at our Investor Day in our Master Plan 3. As Tesla grows, so do our\\ncustomers\\' positive impact on carbon emissions. When I stood here last year, I proudly announced that in 2021, our customers\\navoided emitting 8.4 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions, the equivalent of over 20 billion miles driven by internal\\ncombustion engine vehicles.\\nToday, I can tell you that in 2022, our customers avoided releasing over 13.4 million metric tons of greenhouse gases into the\\natmosphere, the equivalent of over 33 billion miles of driving of internal combustion vehicles. That\\'s an almost 60% increase in\\ntotal emissions savings year-over-year. Putting more of our products in customers\\' hands helps grow that number. And our goals\\nof making our products greener over time and further decarbonizing the electric grid will help multiply that effect.\\nAs part of that goal, I am delighted to say that as described in our recent Impact Report, our global supercharging network was\\nagain 100% renewable in 2022. We\\'ve been able to achieve all of this while maintaining industry margins -- industry-leading\\nmargins and generating strong cash flows over the last several years. Going forward, we will continue our focus on capital\\ninvestment plans to support our future growth with investments in batteries, in vehicle production, including the next-generation\\nplatform, in the building of our lithium refinery that we recently broke ground on, in the energy storage factories, in our sales and\\nservice footprint and in our charging network, among other things.\\nBefore I hand it back to Martin, I would also like to thank Hiro Mizuno for his dedicated service to the Tesla shareholders and the\\nBoard these past 3 years. I would also like to express our enthusiasm on behalf of my fellow directors at the prospect of JB\\nStraubel joining our Board. I don\\'t have to tell you that his passion for Tesla and green tech will make him an important asset in\\nour mission to accelerate the world\\'s transition to sustainable energy. So again, on behalf of our full Board, thank you for your\\ntremendous support, and welcome to your 2023 Shareholder Meeting.\\nAnd with that, I\\'ll hand it back to Martin.\\nMartin Viecha\\nThank you, Robyn. I will now call the meeting to order. Please refer to the meeting agenda that has been provided to you and\\nposted on the virtual meeting site.\\nThe time is now 3:10 p.m. Central Time, and I declare the polls are now open. We have already received, over the last few\\nweeks, voting proxies from stockholders, meaning that almost all the votes that will be counted were already submitted before\\ntoday. However, if you wish to vote your shares or change your prior vote, you may do so through the virtual meeting site. For\\nthose who are in person here today, ballots and ballot boxes were available to you at the check-in.\\nTesla\\'s Board of Directors has appointed Computershare Trust Company to serve as inspector of elections. Computershare has\\ntaken and signed an oath as inspector and has certified that starting on April 6, 2023, the proxy materials or a notice of Internet\\nTesla, Inc. | Event Detail\\nLicensed to martin.thomasmathews@ihsmarkit.com Powered by S&P Global | Page 3 of 20availability of proxy materials were mailed or provided to all Tesla stockholders of record March 20, 2023. We have majority of\\noutstanding shares represented at the meeting, so I declare that there\\'s a quorum present at the meeting, and we may proceed\\nwith the meeting.\\nThe items on the agenda are as follows: number one, the election of Class I directors, Elon Musk, Robyn Denholm and JB\\nStraubel, to serve for a term of 3 years or until the respective successors are duly elected and qualified; number two, to approve\\nexecutive compensation on a nonbinding advisory basis; number three, to approve the frequency of future votes on executive\\ncompensation on a nonbinding advisory basis; number four, to ratify the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as Tesla\\'s\\nindependent public registered accounting firm for the 2023 fiscal year; number five, to vote on a stockholder proposal included in\\nour proxy statement, which relates to the reporting of key person risk; number six, to vote on a stockholder proposal, which the\\nstockholders did not seek to have included in our proxy statement.\\nTesla\\'s Board has recommended that our stockholders vote for each of the director nominees, for the approval by nonbinding\\nadvisory vote of executive compensation and the ratification of appointment of PwC as an independent registered public\\naccounting firm for fiscal year 2023 and every 3 years for nonbinding advisory vote for the frequency of future votes on executive\\ncompensation.\\nWith respect to stockholder proposal included in our proxy statement, which relates to the reporting on the key man risk, Karen\\nRobertsdottir, on behalf of [ SunTrust ], is here to present this proposal. Ms. Robertsdottir, can you please identify yourself? I\\nwould like to invite you to speak. You will have 3 minutes.\\nKaren Robertsdottir\\nHello. Thank you for having me here today. Under discussion is a shareholder proposal concerning key person risk at Tesla\\nrequiring Tesla\\'s Board to draft a report covering the steps taken to ameliorate the potential impacts of loss of key persons in the\\ncompany.\\nHowever, before I begin, I would first like to say thank you to Mr. Musk. For so many of us, you stepped into fields where we had\\nso desperately want to see change. And through bringing in a talented team, willing to put in the long hours, you dragged\\nreluctant industries kicking and screaming into a better future. And for that, thank you building up this juggernaut around us,\\nwhich as you largely put it, runs itself these days. We thank you for that. And yet now here we are today.\\nAt a time when Tesla\\'s technological leadership should be on display, the investment community largely see us on the drift, with\\nmanagement focused on all the matters not Tesla, watching us, Tesla\\'s brand favorability dropped by 15 points last year,\\nsomething that costs us margins. We have such a spectacular product pipeline and a team that knows how to execute at scale\\nwith low cost of goods sold, something that we are not being properly recognized for. It should go without saying, but apparently\\nbears repeating, that if you cannot produce with low COGS, you have no future. When I look around the auto industry these\\ndays, I see a lot of companies that have no future, and that\\'s the success on behalf of an incredible team here at Tesla that\\ndeserves recognition.\\nWhen people look at this company, that\\'s not what they see. They see the company as a synonym for its CEO. And then the\\ndiscussion turns to everything except for where it should be focused. It\\'s my sincere hope that by introducing this proposal, we\\ncan not only accelerate the development of management at Tesla, but also increase its visibility. The fact that this company is so\\nmuch more than its key person is something that the public and the investment community should see.\\nA founder often finds their greatest success in ensuring the future of the company and the development of the management\\ntalent who can come after them. Think Tim Cook at Apple, Steve Ballmer at Microsoft and so forth. People who are ready from\\nday 1 to execute without controversy, without distraction and build a future for the company.\\nI encourage the Board should embrace this opportunity in the most public manner possible to showcase the future being built\\nright here so that the discussion among the public and the investment community revolves around that and not around every\\npublic statement on every other topic made by the leadership. I strongly encourage the Board -- the shareholders to support this\\nproposal and for the Board to embrace it. Thank you very much.\\nMartin Viecha\\nTesla, Inc. | Event Detail\\nLicensed to martin.thomasmathews@ihsmarkit.com Powered by S&P Global | Page 4 of 20Thank you, Ms. Robertsdottir. The Board has recommended that our stockholders vote against this proposal for the reasons set\\nforth in our statement of opposition in our proxy statement.\\nFinally, as you saw, Investor Advocates for Social Justice would like to raise a proposal from the floor. The proponents did not\\nseek to have their proposal included in the proxy statement. The Board recommends that our stockholders who are entitled to\\nvote on this proposal vote against it.\\nAs a reminder, as is disclosed in the proxy statement, I\\'ve been advised by the proxy holders that they intend to vote all shares\\nof stock over which they have discretionary authority against this proposal. Only shareholders who are shareholders of record or\\nhave obtained a legal proxy may vote for this proposal after it is presented.\\nCourtney Wicks, representing Investor Advocates for Social Justice, is here to present the proposal. Ms. Wicks, I would like you\\nto speak. You will have 3 minutes.\\nCourtney Wicks\\nThank you. Good afternoon, Tesla Board members, management, employees and shareholders. My name is Courtney Wicks, and\\nI am the Executive Director for Investor Advocates for Social Justice. And I\\'m here on behalf of As You Sow and the Sisters of\\nthe Good Shepherd, who have filed shareholder proposals in the past on child labor and human rights abuses in Tesla\\'s supply\\nchain, I stand here today to call on shareholders to vote yes on requesting Tesla to conduct a third-party report detailing the\\ncompany\\'s efforts to eradicate child and forced labor in its supply chain. The human rights risks that permeate throughout Tesla\\'s\\nvalue chain when not adequately addressed harm shareholder value and undermine Tesla\\'s ability to lead the just transition.\\nGrowing attention and concern have been placed on child labor in cobalt mining in the Democratic Republic of the Congo as well\\nas on forced labor in China\\'s Xinjiang region.\\n70% of the world\\'s cobalt needed for EV batteries are sourced in the DRC. Over 40,000 children work in artisanal and\\nsmall-scale mining often without protective equipment and in dangerous spaces that frequently collapse. Many children are\\nseriously injured or killed in the mining process. In Tesla\\'s latest sustainability report, it claims to have audited 80% of the miners\\nand refiners in their cobalt supply chain against responsible production standards. However, there are many industry-backed\\nstandards, some of which are weak and it isn\\'t clear what percentage of audits were conducted by which initiatives. It is also\\nunclear how the company\\'s due diligence ensures cobalt sourced from child labor is not intermingled in the industrial cobalt\\nsupply chain. Subsequently, an estimated 1.8 million people have been subject to state imposed genocide, detention and\\ninternment camps and forced labor in the Xinjiang, Uyghur region.\\nA recent study concluded that automakers cannot conduct meaningful audits in this region. The recent Uyghur Forced Labor\\nPrevention Act in the United States sent an inquiry into Tesla\\'s supply chain highlights the regulatory risk Tesla faces. We believe\\na third-party audit would provide greater transparency into how Tesla plans to eradicate child and forced labor from a supply\\nchain. One of Tesla\\'s competitive advantages is its sustainable leadership. Tesla, its Board of Directors and management team\\nhave a moral obligation to pursue ethical sourcing practices that do not rely on the lives of children or enslaved people. Tesla can\\ncontinue to make a true leadership difference that forges a sustainable economic future that is anchored by innovation, empathy,\\nhuman development and shareholder value. Thank you.\\nMartin Viecha\\nThank you, Ms. Wicks. We will now accept votes for, against or to abstain for this proposal, but again, only for record holders or\\nlegal proxy holders. Please note, this is the final opportunity to submit proxies in order for them to be counted.\\n[Voting]\\nMartin Viecha\\nI declare the polls are now closed. Based on proxies we have previously received, I\\'d like to announce on a preliminary basis that\\nour stockholders have approved the recommendations of the Tesla Board on all agenda items, except that shareholders have\\nrecommended 1 year for nonbinding advisory vote on the frequency of future votes on executive compensation. This means that I\\nwould like to officially announce our new addition to the Tesla Board, JB Straubel.\\nAfter the final tabulation is completed, we will announce specific vote tallies filing -- in the filing Form 8-K within 4 business days\\nof this meeting. That concludes the official business of today\\'s shareholder meeting, which is now adjourned.\\nTesla, Inc. | Event Detail\\nLicensed to martin.thomasmathews@ihsmarkit.com Powered by S&P Global | Page 5 of 20During the course of the following session, we may discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. Such\\nstatements are predictions based on current expectations. Actual events could result -- could differ materially due to a number of\\nrisks and uncertainties, including those disclosed in our most recent Form 10-K and 10-Q filings with the SEC. Such forward-\\nlooking statements represent our views as of today, should not be relied on thereafter, and we disclaim from any obligation to\\nupdate them after today.\\nAnd with that, please welcome Elon Musk.\\nElon R. Musk\\nWell, we\\'ve got a lot of great news to talk about today. The Tesla team has done an incredible job of executing over the past\\nyear, and we have many exciting years ahead of us. So yes.\\nSo with the Tesla Master Plan Part 3, which admittedly was quite technical, we wanted to go into a lot of technical depth. So it\\nwas clear that what we were saying was not just -- were not merely assertions, but that they were backed up with physics and\\nwith real data that it\\'s realistic.\\nAnd with the Master Plan Part 3, we want to -- basically, the goal is to give people hope, realistic hope. And maybe hope\\'s even\\nthe wrong word, but simply to say that there is a path to a fully sustainable global economy, that we are on that path, that we are\\naccelerating in that path. And that so long as we don\\'t get complacent about it, it will happen.\\nSo I\\'ll just -- I\\'ll kind of rush through a recap of the Master Plan Part 3. But the -- some of the salient points, that it will actually\\ntake less energy to go sustainable, not more energy. It\\'s actually more -- and some of these things may sound very obvious, but\\nit\\'s more energy efficient to go sustainable, not less. And there\\'s less mining that is required for a sustainable energy economy,\\nnot more. Also very important.\\nAnd I heard a question raised about cobalt mining. And you know what, we will do a third-party audit. In fact, we\\'ll put a webcam\\non the mine. Anybody sees any children, please let us know. I mean I don\\'t want to go off on a tangent too much on that front,\\nbut it\\'s very important to appreciate that most of our battery packs are iron-based. A majority of our battery packs are ion-based,\\nnot cobalt, and then our other battery packs are nickel-based, not cobalt. The nickel batteries use a little bit of cobalt as a binder\\nbut only a tiny amount. In contrast, your phones all use 100% cobalt. I recommend complaining to the phone manufacturers.\\nBut even for the small amount of cobalt that we do use, we will make sure six ways to Sunday that no child labor is being\\nexploited. Obviously, we\\'re a company that cares a lot about doing the right thing, and we don\\'t want to dilute ourselves or dilute\\nanyone else. So yes.\\nSo again, just recapping Master Plan Part 3, it\\'s -- really, the point is to say that it is very doable. It is happening. We need a\\nthreefold increase in solar and wind. We need to [indiscernible] 29-fold increase in vehicle, stationary and thermal battery\\nproduction.\\nActually, in a nutshell, the way to think about sustainability is the faster we can make battery packs, the faster we can move to a\\nsustainable energy economy. That\\'s the fundamental limiting factor. So I\\'m just going to grab some water here.\\nSo yes, I can\\'t emphasize that point enough. The rate of lithium-ion battery production fundamentally decides the rate at which\\nthe world transitions to sustainability, because the batteries are needed for all forms of transport and for stationary storage, given\\nthe intimate nature of solar and wind power.\\nSo the -- and we do invite our people to critique our analysis because any given analysis is going to be, to some degree, wrong.\\nSo we -- that\\'s why we put it out there, looking for critical feedback to say, well, perhaps we\\'ve got some things wrong. Perhaps\\nsome things need to be adjusted. But generally, the feedback we\\'ve gotten is that actually our analysis is quite accurate. And\\nwe\\'ve not seen any rebuttals thus far that would cause us to change our assumptions.\\nSo it means roughly 240 terawatt hours of battery pack or 240,000 gigawatt hours of battery need to be produced, but it will only\\ntake 0.2% of land area for solar and wind because very -- it\\'s not like we need to carpet the earth with solar. And wind, it\\'s just\\nliterally a fraction of 1%, roughly a $10 trillion manufacturing investment, which relative to the global economy is actually a small\\nTesla, Inc. | Event Detail\\nLicensed to martin.thomasmathews@ihsmarkit.com Powered by S&P Global | Page 6 of 20number. Yes, roughly 10% of the world economy. I think obviously -- I think 10% of the world economy is a small price to pay for\\na sustainable energy future.\\nIt\\'s also true that even when factoring in the cost -- or the emissions required to produce an electric vehicle, which for now are a\\nlittle higher than gasoline vehicles, when you look at the emissions over time, electric vehicles absolutely win by a long shot. And\\nas we\\'re seeing the cost and the emissions required to produce an electric vehicle are dropping rapidly over time, and we\\'re\\ngoing to get to the point where an electric vehicle is lower -- is cheaper than a gasoline vehicle.\\nSo in 2022, we avoided releasing about 13 million tons of CO2, reduced manufacturing GHG per vehicle by 30% and reduced\\nwater usage by 15% despite massive increases in output. So we also made our factory safer, which is really important. So we\\ntrack the injuries per person. And we believe at this point, we are best in industry or have the lowest injuries per person.\\nWe\\'re now actually quite a big company from a head count standpoint. This is our direct employment numbers. So this does not\\ncount contractors. And for every manufacturing job, depending on how you count it, there are at least 5, sometimes up to 10 jobs\\ncreated, because you got to look at the total supply chain as well as the -- all of the support functions. So when you create a\\nfactory like this, you actually create jobs for teachers, lawyers, carpenters, electricians, and restaurants and everything that\\'s\\nrequired to support a person at a factory. And this is why countries and states are so interested in having manufacturing facilities\\nin their location. So anyway, it\\'s a lot of people gainfully employed doing very useful things.\\nWe received a 3.6 million job applications last year. So -- and once again, the top 2 most desired companies for engineers on\\nearth were SpaceX and Tesla. At the end of the day, the competitiveness of any given company is a function of what -- where are\\nthe most talented people interested in working. That is the team that\\'s going to win. In fact, I\\'d say this is generally the case. If\\nyou look at any given company and say, where are the most smartest, most driven people going to work? That company is going\\nto win. So whether it\\'s Tesla or any other company.\\nWe\\'re also excited to announce our next-gen drive unit, which is a big reduction in silicon carbide. It\\'s half the battery space.\\nNotably, there are 0 rare earth elements required. And we\\'re also changing to a 48-volt low-voltage architecture in the car. So the\\n-- yes, this is a big deal, actually. So the cars have been operating with 12-volt batteries for basically about a century.\\nSo for the first time in I think over 100 years, we\\'re actually going to change from 12-volt voltage of -- outside of the drive train to\\na 48-volt architecture. And first approximation, that means we need only about 1/4 as much copper in the car as would be\\nneeded for a 12-volt battery. So that\\'s a big deal because people are often worried about is there enough copper? Yes, there is.\\nAnd FSD Beta is growing hyper-exponentially. So that chart is going to look like a wall, basically. And just a question for those in\\nthe room. Are -- have -- how many people have tried out FSD Beta? So what do you think of the latest build? So it\\'s really\\ngetting to a point where it\\'s -- at least for me, when I drive around, it\\'s several days between interventions. And I think we\\'re\\ngetting to the point where there\\'s really just one last piece of the system that needs to be a neural net, which is the planning and\\ncontrol function. And so we expect to have that last piece become neural net, so it will be end-to-end from video into control out\\nas a neural net.\\nAnd yes, so -- the thing to appreciate is it\\'s not that full self-driving will be as good as a person. It will be much, much better, like\\na lot, like over time, 10x more -- 10x safer than a person. It\\'s not even going to be a contest, frankly. So this is a really big deal.\\nAnd I think some people realize -- that I think you guys probably realize it, but being able to do a software update and have\\nseveral million cars suddenly go from manual driving to autonomous, I think will be the single biggest asset value increase in\\nhistory. The normal usage of a passenger car is roughly 10 to 12 hours per week, call it, maybe 1.5 hours per day.\\nAnd when you drive around, you see less of cars just parked in parking lots, because out of the 168 hours in a week, they\\'re\\nusing less than 10%, maybe 7% of the hours of the week a car is in use. But once it is autonomous, it can be used probably, I\\ndon\\'t know, 50 hours a week, maybe more. So it is effectively a fivefold increase in the value of a car overnight.\\nI\\'m actually surprised that -- so a few people realize this or maybe they just don\\'t believe it\\'s real, but it is. So this is really an\\ninsanely big deal.\\nWe\\'re also the largest EV maker in the world. So yes, I think that will continue. And while at the same time, being the highest\\nTesla, Inc. | Event Detail\\nLicensed to martin.thomasmathews@ihsmarkit.com Powered by S&P Global | Page 7 of 20margin of any carmaker in the world.\\nNow making electric vehicles profitably is hard as illustrated by the difficulty of our competitors. A number of our competitors are\\nmaking EVs at a significant loss. So -- but we are not. We are actually making EVs profitably, and almost no one else is.\\nThis is hard. So -- and I\\'d say for this, it\\'s a massive credit to the Tesla team for -- I can\\'t tell you how hard manufacturing is. It\\'s\\nlike you\\'ve probably heard me say that prototypes are easy, manufacturing is hard. And then manufacturing at scale with positive\\ncash flow is excruciating. This is mega pain. But the Tesla team has done it.\\nAnd as you can see, our free cash flow per year has been increasing steadily. So we\\'re making good progress. I mean it should\\nbe said that -- and I\\'ve made some of these comments that interest rates make up a very big -- have a very big effect on the\\naffordability of cars. So the vast majority of people buy cars based on the monthly payment. So it\\'s like how much money -- how\\nmuch is the monthly payment, and it\\'s not a question of value for money. It\\'s just do they actually have enough money? Can they\\nafford it?\\nSo for the vast majority of people is just can they afford to pay the payment? As the interest rates increase and credit tightens,\\nlike it\\'s safe to say that these various banks that have died are probably somewhat distracted from handing out auto loans. It\\'s\\nlike if they\\'re on the way to the cemetery, increasing their auto loan portfolio is not the first thing on their mind.\\nSo this is going to be a challenging -- I\\'d say, a challenging 12 months. I want to be sort of realistic about it. Tesla is not immune\\nto the global economic environment. I expect things to be, just at a macroeconomic level, difficult for at least the next 12 months.\\nTesla will get through it, and we\\'ll do well. And I think we\\'ll see a lot of companies actually go bankrupt.\\nSo I want to make sure that this is not just the good news parade. It\\'s important to understand that no company is immune to the\\nmacroeconomic environment. But that said, the -- it won\\'t be darkness forever. I expect probably a year of difficulty globally for\\neveryone. And then my best guess is that the global economy turns around in roughly 12 months. And then Tesla will be in an\\nextremely good position. So anyone who is a long-term investor, I think, will do extremely well.\\nAnd here, I want to give a big shout-out to the Tesla internal software team. This is -- it\\'s actually a really big deal that Tesla has\\nsuch a powerful internal software team. I mean that software team is responsible for handling the entire customer experience\\nfrom buying the car, delivering the car, operating the factories, service and support. We internally wrote all of the insurance and\\nfinancial software.\\nThe -- it\\'s -- with the supply chain and logistics stuff, the data centers and infrastructure and the analytics insight, this is all\\ninternally written Tesla software. I think there\\'s -- there are almost no companies in the world can do this because they do not\\nhave a very talented internal software team. So they\\'re generally reliant on third-party enterprise resource planning software. So\\n-- but Tesla is not. This is a hidden strength of the company that often doesn\\'t get a lot of attention, but is incredibly powerful. So\\nonce again, I\\'d like to thank them for their work.\\nAnd as predicted, we are highly confident that Model Y will be the #1 best-selling car on earth this year. And in fact, in Europe,\\nthe best-selling car of any kind whatsoever. It already was that in Q1, I should say. It\\'s not like it will be. It was that in Q1. And\\nChina, the bestselling SUV. And the United States, the best-selling non-pickup vehicle in the United States in Q1. So it\\'s going\\nwell.\\nI don\\'t know if this is like the optimal picture, but the Tesla cars are actually the safest cars in the world. We put immense effort\\ninto vehicle safety, and we keep updating the safety. So we keep improving the automatic emergency braking system just with a\\nsoftware update, and we keep improving the airbag deployment with software updates. So we closed the feedback loop on -- like\\nwhen we see an accident, we analyze the accident, and we say, what can we do from a software standpoint?\\nBecause there\\'s actually quite a lot you can do to, first of all, avoid the accident because the best accident is no accident. And\\nthen if the accident occurs, how do we deploy the airbags and the sort of the seatbelt pretensioners to minimize the probability of\\ninjury? And so even for cars that people have owned for many years, we are behind the scenes continuously improving the\\nsafety of your car.\\nAnd there are even some things that I think a lot of people aren\\'t aware of that we actually have automatic cabin overheat\\nTesla, Inc. | Event Detail\\nLicensed to martin.thomasmathews@ihsmarkit.com Powered by S&P Global | Page 8 of 20protection. So never in the history of the company has a child or a pet died in a Tesla. So it\\'s one of those like little-known\\nfeatures, but because we have a large battery, and we\\'re monitoring things all the time, we can make sure that the cabin\\ntemperature never gets to lethal levels. And I think that\\'s a big deal.\\nSo yes. So -- and then while lots of cars will say they\\'ve got like 5 stars or whatever, there\\'s nuance to that. When we do -- did\\nthe European NCAP sort of active safety tests, we got the highest scores that they\\'ve ever seen. So yes. So we got a 98% score\\non the active safety system, which, obviously, isn\\'t good enough, and we will -- but -- we have got a game plan for getting rid of\\nthe last 2%.\\nAnd then it\\'s worth noting things like the total cost of ownership of a Model 3 is now comparable to that of a Toyota Corolla.\\nSuperchargers, we\\'re making good progress. So our Supercharger uptime is now 99.5%. So yes. And we have supercharges\\npractically everywhere at this point.\\nGoing to Megapack because this is a stationary storage, is an important part of solving the sustainable energy problem. And the\\nTesla Megapack is now more competitive than a natural gas peaker plant. So we have very strong demand for the Tesla\\nMegapack, and we\\'re going to make a lot of them.\\nAnd a while back, I predicted that the Tesla stationary battery pack business would actually grow faster than the automotive side\\nof things, and that\\'s exactly what has happened. You can see it\\'s an exponential curve, growing at a rate that is even faster than\\nour vehicle sales -- yes, sorry.\\nWe\\'re expanding Gigafactory Nevada for the Tesla semi production line and for the 4680 in-house cell production. And yes, some\\nMegafactory.\\nSo this is sort of -- we\\'re aiming for 40 gigawatt hours a year, both in California and in China, but I think long term, this will be\\nmuch, much greater than this. I mean I would say I wouldn\\'t be surprised if long term, the stationary battery pack activity went\\nwell in excess of 500 gigawatt hours per year. So the demand is like quasi-infinite here.\\nAs we look ahead to tackle the -- what we see as the choke points in the supply chain, one of them is lithium refining. And I think\\nthere have been a few times on Tesla earnings calls where I\\'ve said, can someone please just do lithium refining because it\\'s --\\nthere\\'s a shortage of it? And -- but we really see very little activity outside of China for lithium refining. So it\\'s not that we wish to\\ntake on extra problems, but since nobody else was doing it, we felt we had to do this. And so we\\'ve just broken ground on lithium\\nrefinery in Corpus Christi, which will be more lithium refining that I think probably everything outside of China. And we signed a\\ndeal for a next Gigafactory in Mexico, Giga Mexico. I think that\\'s going to be a fantastic factory. So we\\'re laying the groundwork\\nfor ultimately getting to 20 million vehicles a year.\\nSo Cybertruck is a hard car to make. It\\'s -- because it\\'s such a radically new design, it actually -- you can\\'t just use conventional\\nmethods of manufacturing. We had to invent a whole new set of manufacturing techniques in order to build an exoskeleton-based\\ncar instead of an endoskeleton-based car. So it\\'s extremely nontrivial to build Cybertruck, but we\\'re making good progress on\\nthat. We have -- so yes, that\\'s the thing I -- when I -- in the factory, I tour the Cybertruck lines, see how we\\'re doing there. And\\nsorry for the delay, we\\'re finally going to start delivering production Cybertrucks later this year. And I think the product, if anything,\\nis better than expectations.\\nCybertruck is the car I will be driving on a day-to-day basis. And people always want to know what our next product is. But this is\\nnot the time to -- we obviously need to have a proper dedicated product launch. I just want to emphasize that we are actually\\nbuilding a new product. We are actually designing a new product. We\\'re not sitting on our hands here. So there are 2 new\\nproducts that I think you\\'ll be very excited about. And both the design of the products and the manufacturing techniques are head\\nand shoulders above anything else that is present in industry. So yes, anyways.\\nIf I were to guess, I would say of these 2 new products -- just these 2 new products alone, I would say there\\'s -- we will probably\\nmake -- obviously, this is just Elon\\'s guess, so don\\'t sue me. But Elon\\'s guess is that we\\'ll probably make in excess of 5 million\\nunits a year of these 2 models combined.\\n[Presentation]\\nTesla, Inc. | Event Detail\\nLicensed to martin.thomasmathews@ihsmarkit.com Powered by S&P Global | Page 9 of 20Elon R. Musk\\nI think the thing perhaps most notable is if you look at the difference between the last time we showed Optimus, and this is a\\nvideo that was taken basically yesterday, and the Optimus team was up all night making this video, the Optimus team has done\\nan incredible job. So just -- yes.\\nAnd it\\'s -- the motors, the controllers, the electronics and everything you see in the Optimus robot is a Tesla designed system. So\\nthis is -- we actually try to find drive actuators and whatnot that were off the shelf. We found that there weren\\'t any. In order to\\nmake an effective humanoid robot, you actually have to design the motors and gearboxes and the electronics from scratch\\nbecause it\\'s a very different application from anything else that exists. So we took our world-class motor and power electronics\\nteam and said, okay, we need to design several actuators that are -- that don\\'t exist in the world, and they did. So Optimus is\\nworking quite well.\\nAnd then for full self-driving, as full self-driving gets closer and closer to generalized real-world AI, that same software is\\ntransferable to a humanoid robot. Just like humans can obviously walk around with their arms and legs, but we can drive a car,\\nfly a plane, steer a boat, ride a horse. If you have a generalized understanding -- if you have generalized real-world AI, which is\\nwhat we are developing for full self-driving, it can be transferred to basically anything.\\nAnd so Optimus will use the same FEC computer as the car. And the Optimus stuff is, I think, somewhat -- not somewhat,\\nextremely underrated because people just cannot comprehend the consequences. Now obviously, we need to make sure that we\\ndon\\'t have a Terminator scenario. That\\'s very important. It\\'s all fun and games until Terminator shows up. But if you say if you\\nhave had a generalized humanoid robot, what would be the effective ratio of humanoid robots to humans? Because I think\\nbasically, everyone would want one, and maybe people would want more than 1. Which means the actual demand for something\\nlike Optimus, if it really works, which it will, is -- I don\\'t know, I mean 10 billion units? It\\'s some crazy number.\\nIt might be 20 billion units. If the ratio is, say, 2:1 on people, humanoid robots versus people, it might actually be -- it\\'s some very\\nbig number is what I\\'m saying, a number vastly in excess of the number of cars.\\nSo my prediction is that Tesla\\'s long-term value will be -- a majority of long-term value will be Optimus. And that prediction I am\\nvery confident of.\\nSo anyway. Let\\'s see, so I think with that, we can do questions, perhaps? We also want to make sure retail investors, please\\nvote. Normally, retail investors for most companies don\\'t vote, but we really care about your vote of small investors, not just large\\ninvestors. So please do register to vote. Your vote is very important. And yes, I think that\\'s -- yes, that\\'s it.\\nQuestion and Answer\\nElon R. Musk\\nSo with that, we can go to ad hoc questions from the audience. Okay. Definitely, the person in the Optimus output with the red\\ncowboy hat. Great outfit. Sure. We\\'ll try to get through as many questions as possible. And hit me with your toughest questions.\\nIt\\'s fine.\\nUnknown Attendee\\nHey, dad, it\\'s your son, Optimus. Do you see it more likely that you guys will have an RV first or a Cyber camper?\\nElon R. Musk\\nWe don\\'t have any plans with an RV quite yet, although I can certainly see how cybertruck could be converted into an RV. And\\nwe are adding a lot of sort of attach points to Cybertruck. So others can build things. Somebody can have a startup or other\\ncompanies can build things that are attachments that enhance Cybertruck and turn it into a camper essentially because I think it\\'d\\nbe really cool to have all these third-party things available for Cybertruck.\\nI mean you can also probably just -- you\\'re back close, you can just say it.\\nUnknown Executive\\nWe\\'d like you to queue behind us.\\nTesla, Inc. | Event Detail\\nLicensed to martin.thomasmathews@ihsmarkit.com Powered by S&P Global | Page 10 of 20Elon R. Musk\\nTry to make the questions short, so we can get through a lot of questions. You mean just like a Tesla team doing a podcast about\\nOptimus? Yes, yes, sure. Yes, I wonder if maybe we could have a sort of like an addendum after the earnings call, which is like\\n30 minutes podcast on Optimus or something like for those who are interested. Okay. I think we\\'ll do that.\\nUnknown Attendee\\nElon, thanks for doing this today. It\\'s an awesome event.\\nElon R. Musk\\nYou\\'re welcome. Thanks for coming. Hope you guys are having a good time. I\\'m pretty confident we have the funniest\\nshareholders meeting by a long shot.\\nUnknown Attendee\\nUndoubtedly. It\\'s amazing. So I\\'m really excited about a lot of things with Tesla, it\\'s hard to pick a good question that is going to\\ncover everything. But with the energy side of the business, I think it\\'s hugely underrated. I mean we\\'ve got tons of problems. I\\nmean, California with rolling blackouts. How do you think you can incentivize people more for solar, battery backup? And we\\'ve\\ngot the referral program that has been beefed up as well. So what are your thoughts there, how we can get people on board?\\nElon R. Musk\\nYes. Actually, 1 of the challenges in California and a few other places is that in order to have the Powerwall be like an\\nuninterruptible power supply for the house, we have to actually have a switch that disconnects you from the utility. Otherwise, you\\njust send energy into the grid, and it doesn\\'t do anything. And that\\'s actually been quite difficult with the utilities. But I\\'d like to\\nthank PG&E for recently helping us get approval for installing the backup switch for Powerwall in California so that people can\\nhave uninterrupted power in California. And we\\'re working on that in every jurisdiction. So I\\'m confident that that\\'s going to be a\\ngreat long-term situation. And then as I mentioned, Megapack is growing very, very rapidly. And yes, so things are -- I mean,\\nthings are really growing like ridiculously fast on the energy storage front. So yes, I feel good about that situation. All right, next\\nquestion?\\nUnknown Attendee\\nElon, a lot of people have just been wondering how are you doing? So just wondering what\\'s up, how you do and how you\\nfeeling? We saw you were at a party in Cabo recently. So how are you doing? Just human to human, how are you doing?\\nElon R. Musk\\nWell, I have to say, it\\'s been of a rollercoaster situation. And like it\\'s actually pretty rare for me to be at a party. So that\\'s like the\\nfirst party I\\'ve been at in a while. And actually, I wasn\\'t even going to go to it, my brother talked me into it. So thanks, Kimbal.\\nSo yes, I have to say like -- sometimes the work pain level is quite excruciating. And then on top of that, I get dumped on in the\\npress. So it\\'s like -- it\\'s not exactly super fun. But there was a short-term distraction because I had to do like some major\\nopen-heart surgery on Twitter to ensure the company\\'s survival.\\nBut that, I think Twitter is now in a stable place, and obviously very excited to have Linda Jacovino join. And so I think Linda is\\ngoing to do a great job running Twitter. And I\\'ll provide, obviously, guidance on technology development. But as you can see, I\\nthink Twitter at this point has released more new features in the last 6 months than it has in the last 6 years. So obviously, this is\\nnot a Twitter meeting, but the larger point is that I feel at this point, I don\\'t need to devote incremental time. The amount of time\\nthat Twitter will take going forward is relatively small compared to the last 6 months.\\nSo again apart from like there\\'s like some macroeconomic things that we can\\'t do anything about, overall, I feel very good about\\nthe health of the companies. And I\\'m increasingly optimistic about the future. Thanks for asking. It\\'s kind of you to ask.\\nUnknown Attendee\\nHave you guys considered stretching out the financing terms on your auto business? You talked about earlier consumers don\\'t\\nnecessarily look at the sticker price they\\'re paying. All they\\'re concerned about is monthly payment. And one of the fundamental\\nadvantages of an EV is that it\\'s substantially more durable. And so would you guys ever consider stretching terms out to 10\\nyears, especially in this rate environment? Given the shape of the yield curve, extending the terms out that farther you\\'d actually\\nbe capturing a lower cost of funds.\\nTesla, Inc. | Event Detail\\nLicensed to martin.thomasmathews@ihsmarkit.com Powered by S&P Global | Page 11 of 20Elon R. Musk\\nYes. I mean the important thing to appreciate is that like that the vast majority of the financing is from banks. So it\\'s kind of\\nwhatever the banks are prepared to do. I mean this year, I guess we\\'ll do on the order of $100 billion of sales, and we don\\'t have\\n$100 billion in cash to finance that. So the vast majority of it has got to come from banks. So it\\'s really the bank\\'s choice of what\\nthey\\'re willing to do.\\nAnd it has been tricky with banks recently because, as I mentioned earlier, it\\'s -- if you\\'re a bank and you\\'re not sure whether\\nyou\\'re going to be alive or not, it\\'s a pretty big distraction. And increasing your auto loan portfolio is very much a secondary\\npriority. So it\\'s just important to appreciate. It\\'s not up to Tesla, it\\'s up to the banks. And there\\'s not some easy solution where you\\ncan say, have a so-called captive financing arm, et cetera, because you have to securitize those loans. And the market for\\nsecuritizing them is weak. There is no -- I wish there was an easy path, but there isn\\'t. So I think just important to remember that\\nthe economy moves in cycles, and we\\'ve had a very long period of upcycle.\\nThe next 12 months will be, I think, difficult for everyone. And I think when Berkshire Hathaway had their annual meeting, Warren\\nand Charlie actually said, hey, this year, the Berkshire companies are going to make less money. And they\\'re very well-run\\norganizations. And I think that\\'s just generally true for the economy.\\nBut it\\'s also important to remember that there are good times and there are dark times, but then the good times follow the dark\\ntimes. So my advice would be don\\'t look at the markets for the next 12 months. If there\\'s a dip, buy the dip. And I think you will\\nnot be sorry because there\\'s just generally sort of -- there\\'s an economic cycle to things, but things come back up. So my guess\\nis tough times for 1 year.\\nLike I said, this is just my guess. And -- but then Tesla will emerge stronger than ever and the long term, if you say like net\\npresent value of future cash flows will be incredible in my opinion.\\nUnknown Attendee\\nElon, meet Kevin here. So Tesla is the largest position in my ETF, ticker PP, and -- that\\'s for pricing power. And I\\'m curious. I\\nreally think that some of the features that you highlighted here, like the over-the-air airbag deployments of improving the features\\n-- the safety features are great things that we could be advertising. I know you\\'ve heard this many times before. But $525 of\\nevery car this year is half of Netflix\\'s advertising budget. $1,000 is the entire Netflix advertising budget, and I see their ads\\neverywhere. Why not advertise these things that you told us here? I feel like nobody else knows about this. I just talked to Gordo,\\nthe Tesla Bayer. And he\\'s still talking about 2016 New York Times pieces. These people are in the past, man.\\nElon R. Musk\\nThat\\'s like 7 years ago at this point.\\nUnknown Attendee\\nThat\\'s what I\\'m saying.\\nElon R. Musk\\nYes. It\\'s actually -- I talk to a lot of people, and they still think that like Teslas are like super expensive and like, no, actually, the\\nstarting price for a Tesla is below the average auto price in the U.S. It\\'s like -- and that\\'s a good thing. I mean I think it\\'s good\\nthat it\\'s that way. Like our goal was always to make cars that are affordable to the general public. So I hear you.\\nI mean, I think -- and indeed ironic that Twitter is like highly dependent on advertising. So here I am never used advertising really\\nbefore and now have a company that\\'s highly dependent on advertising. So I guess I should say advertising is awesome.\\nEveryone should do it.\\nBut I think I hear your sort of larger point, which is that there are amazing features and functionality about Teslas that people just\\ndon\\'t know about. And although there\\'s obviously a lot of people that follow like, say, the Tesla account and my account,\\nwhatever, on Twitter, to some degree, it is preaching to the choir, and the choir is already convinced.\\nSo I think what you\\'re saying does have some merits. And you know what, I believe in taking suggestions. So we\\'ll try a little\\nadvertising and see how it goes.\\nTesla, Inc. | Event Detail\\nLicensed to martin.thomasmathews@ihsmarkit.com Powered by S&P Global | Page 12 of 20Okay. Okay. I wasn\\'t expecting that level of enthusiasm. But okay, it sounds like our shareholders, if I read between the lines,\\nsubtle as it is saying, we probably should just use some advertising. Okay, very well. All right.\\nUnknown Attendee\\nElon, so my question is regarding you recently asked him to the car, and that\\'s great. We can play video games. Is this like\\ncurrently developing the ability for other parties to develop apps for the car? For example, if we can buy actually customizable\\nTeams for the operatorship of the car, I think you comment on revenue there like that space teams for the car or Lord of the\\nRings or stuff like that. Do you have any interest on that right now?\\nElon R. Musk\\nWell, I mean, important -- so I think the notion of having entertainment apps and whatnot becomes increasingly important as the\\ncars achieve self-driving. Because otherwise, you can only really watch, play games or watch movies or whatever when the car is\\nstationary. If it\\'s charging or whatever then you can use it. But when it\\'s at the point in which it\\'s full self-driving, I think it\\'s very\\nmuch about entertainment and productivity. So I think that is something that might make sense in the future. But overwhelmingly,\\nthe focus right now for Tesla software, apart from improving safety, is achieving full self-driving and then getting full self-driving to\\nbe much safer than human driving. And then once we achieve full self-driving, I think there could be a lot of opportunity for apps\\nand whatnot.\\nSo -- but even in the car as it is today, for a Model S and X, we\\'ve made sort of a full Steam integration. So you can actually just\\nliterally log on with the model S or X with your Steam account and play any game that is on Steam, which is a lot of games,\\nwhich is pretty wild. I think a lot of people don\\'t know that. You can play with a keyboard or mouse, you can play with a joystick\\nor a controller. You can also play Netflix, YouTube or anything else.\\nFor my little son X, he loves watching -- actually, loves watching rocket videos in the rear screen of the Model S and X. So yes,\\nso it is something that we will do long term.\\nBut what I\\'m saying is we already have a lot of stuff there, and we\\'ll do more as self-driving becomes a reality.\\nUnknown Attendee\\nElon. I\\'m John or Dr. Know it All on YouTube, and I don\\'t know it all, but anyway, my question is, as you guys move completely or\\nfinish the transition in full self-driving from version 1.0 of the software to 2.0, what do you perceive of as the like potential\\nstumbling blocks after that? Because it seems like that\\'s the major kind of step change that needed to happen and so you\\'re\\nalmost done with that and what happens after that. And also, please let me interview you about full self-driving. Like I\\'ll spend 2\\nhours with you on just that.\\nElon R. Musk\\nWell, one can really think about full self-driving as sort of a march of 9s of reliability, so we need to get to a point where the\\nprobability of injury is lower than that of the average human driver, and then ultimately, probability of injuries is much lower. So\\neven at the point at which the car is capable of driving itself, there\\'s still a lot of work to do. Because every year, there\\'s 1 million\\npeople that die in auto accidents. And I think probably everyone in this audience has friends and family that, that have died or\\nhave been seriously injured in auto accidents. And for every -- there\\'s like a million people that died , there\\'s 10 million people\\nroughly that are seriously or permanently injured.\\nAnd so it matters that we -- if we can get that down by an order of magnitude, there\\'s like 900,000 lives saved per year, maybe 9\\nmillion severe injuries prevented per year. And so that really, I think, morally has to be our primary goal. And I guess I\\'m open to\\nan interview on FSD. Two hours is a long time -- okay, okay. All right. I\\'ll do an interview, it\\'s got to be on Twitter, but sure.\\nUnknown Attendee\\nElon, I\\'m Josh Phillips, long-term retail investor. My question is about battery grade lithium supply in the next 10 years. Lithium\\nexperts all agree that mines are just not coming on fast enough to meet battery supply. And actually drawing back to your point\\nthis out recently. Some mines take 10 years plus to be permitted. And even GM has actually announced like huge lithium deals\\nthat were like secure way supply from the rest of the industry. So what\\'s Tesla\\'s plans to get more supply of lithium at the mine\\nlevel outside of refining, but also at a deeper level than a traditional offtake? Because as we know, he who controls the space,\\ncontrols the universe.\\nTesla, Inc. | Event Detail\\nLicensed to martin.thomasmathews@ihsmarkit.com Powered by S&P Global | Page 13 of 20Elon R. Musk\\nSure. So I actually think that the industry analysis is incorrect. And the constraint is fundamentally that of processing. So now our\\nrefinery in Corpus Christi that we\\'re building is primarily oriented towards refining spodumene, of which there is a truly vast\\namount in the world. About -- I think about 3/4 of our lithium comes from Australia. And frankly, you could increase the rate at\\nwhich the mines are operating. And the limiting factor is not how fast can you mine, but how fast can you process?\\nSo the mines are only going to produce ore at the rate at which refineries can handle the ore or it\\'s pointless. So I think my\\nopinion, and obviously, I could be wrong about this, but is that -- it\\'s really not about the lithium ore. Lithium is extremely\\ncommon. Lithium is everywhere. Every country has got lithium. It\\'s not like oil. So lithium is 1 of the most common elements on\\nEarth. But taking the lithium ore and refining it to battery grade is extremely difficult because the purity levels required for a\\nbattery are extremely high. If you have even a small impurity then you will degrade the life of the cell dramatically. So you need\\nultrapure battery-grade lithium, and that\\'s why our focus is on refining as opposed to mining.\\nUnknown Attendee\\nElon, thanks, it\\'s a great time here. You spoke about safety in your presentation of the vehicles, and I just want to say I\\'m\\nthankful to you for building such a safe vehicle because I\\'m here today with my son. We drove in his Tesla 3 over here that he\\nreplaced with the 1 that he got rear ended significantly and destroyed the car, but we\\'re able to be here today. So thank you very\\nmuch.\\nUnknown Attendee\\nMy name is Austin Gregory. I\\'ll ask about this because I don\\'t think it gets near enough love. But I was wondering if there are any\\nupdates on the next-gen Roadster, actually. I know it\\'s sort of like the cherry on top and all that stuff. And you guys have a lot on\\nyour plate as you said before, but if there\\'s any updates on like the release timeline, all that stuff to SpaceX package maybe.\\nThat would be amazing.\\nElon R. Musk\\nIt\\'s totally a fair and reasonable question. Where is that thing? So we expect to complete the engineering and design of the\\nnext-gen Tesla Roadster this year. And hopefully, start production -- this is not a commitment, but hopefully start production next\\nyear.\\nSo it is like -- as you alluded to, it\\'s not even icing on the cake. It\\'s the cherry on the icing on the cake. So I wouldn\\'t expect it to\\nbe like -- it\\'s definitely not going to be a huge contributor to revenue. It will be a modest contributor to profitability. But it will be\\nsick.\\nThere\\'s some value to me running 2 companies because the next-gen Roadster will have the SpaceX option package. So that\\nwill make it truly next level.\\nUnknown Attendee\\nElon, Eva McMillan here. First of all, I want to thank you for making the absolute best, safest and most fun cars in the whole\\nworld. Cars in Florida, we are seeing many, many more cars in Florida than a year ago. A matter of fact, cars have doubled. So\\nthe question is, we all want Tesla insurance. Does it come in?\\nElon R. Musk\\nYes, yes, actually, that\\'s a great question. X is coming later this year. But I have to tell you like 1 of the thorniest things in the\\nUnited States is car insurance or insurance in general because it\\'s a state by state, and every state has got different rules and\\nregulations. So that\\'s why it\\'s not like rolled out nationwide.\\nI think really, there should be 1 national standard for insurance, especially car insurance. I think it would improve the cost\\neffectiveness of car insurance, but our intent is to roll out nationwide and ultimately internationally. But there is a staggering\\namount of paperwork that is needed to get it done. But as Zach said, we expect to offer Tesla insurance in Florida later this year.\\nThank you.\\nUnknown Attendee\\nTesla, Inc. | Event Detail\\nLicensed to martin.thomasmathews@ihsmarkit.com Powered by S&P Global | Page 14 of 20Elon. Alexandra Mertz. I\\'m Tesla Boomer Mama, very happy to be here. So very grateful to the Tesla team and you of course.\\nJust want you to know we love the emotions every day, joy and less joy, but we\\'re there, shareholders. It\\'s not easy. We\\'re here,\\nnot because it\\'s easy, but because it\\'s hard.\\nSo my question initially was on in-house financing. You already answered that, and I want to congratulate you to the double\\ninvestment grade rating. But then I asked my Twitter subscribers, I\\'m sure you\\'re going to appreciate what they wanted to bring\\nforward, and that question made the cut. Here we go.\\nAutomotive, including SAS, peak margin, the same for energy. What number? And by when do you have the best Elon Gas that\\nwe get there?\\nElon R. Musk\\nSo I\\'m not sure I fully understand the question.\\nUnknown Attendee\\nSo this is the peak margin for automobile, including SaaS and energy, and by when will we get there? Your guess. I know\\nnobody will sue you.\\nElon R. Musk\\nSorry, what\\'s SaaS?\\nUnknown Attendee\\nWell, software-as-a-service.\\nElon R. Musk\\nOkay. You mean FSD, self-driving?\\nUnknown Attendee\\nIn FSD, what\\'s going to be the top automobile margin.\\nElon R. Musk\\nYes, yes. I mean what I was saying earlier is that at the point in which you have a truly autonomous vehicle that can drive around\\nwith no one in it. The utility of the vehicle, I think as a rough guess, is probably 5x what it is today because people will drive an\\naverage of 1.5 hours a day, perhaps 10 hours a week. But if the car is autonomous, it can probably -- this is just speculation, but\\nit probably can operate for 1/3 of the hours in the week, which would mean 50 or more hours. That\\'s a fivefold increase. But the\\ncar costs the same.\\nUnknown Attendee\\nSure. I understand, but what is going to be the margin for Tesla then? Because you are obviously thinking you\\'re going to sell\\nmuch more FSD then, right, you may have a system in place of robotaxis, you may have a cut with fleets. So did you do any\\nprojections what the automotive peak margin for Tesla could be in 2 years, 5 years? And the same for energy.\\nElon R. Musk\\nWell, I mean, this is definitely -- we\\'re in sort of highly speculative territory here. But obviously, if you\\'ve got a car that costs the\\nsame and has a, I don\\'t know, a 20% or 25% margin, and suddenly is able to be used 5x as much, then you might have 80%\\nmargins. And the revenue would increase severalfold. That\\'s why I say it\\'s the -- it\\'s probably going to be the biggest asset value\\nstep change in history of earth.\\nAnd energy does not have -- energy simply does not have such an increase in asset utilization. So I would expect energy to be --\\nto remain at sort of 20%, 25%-ish to 30% margin.\\nUnknown Attendee\\nAll right. So you said ask the tough questions You\\'re still good, right?\\nElon R. Musk\\nTesla, Inc. | Event Detail\\nLicensed to martin.thomasmathews@ihsmarkit.com Powered by S&P Global | Page 15 of 20Yes.\\nUnknown Attendee\\nAll right, cool. First of all, though, as a family man, I just want to say there\\'s a couple of things like a loop for a tether of a car\\nseat going through the headrest, which would be super helpful. There\\'s a couple of other things that would be really nice. Model\\nwise is the only 1 you can do that in today. Maybe we could fix that.\\nBut when we\\'re thinking about 4680 battery cells. Should we be thinking about the efficiency and the performance we\\'re getting\\ntoday? Or is there some updated timeline path that we could see closer to battery day presented efficiency performance that we\\ncan look to in the future?\\nElon R. Musk\\nWell, I think first of all, it\\'s really important to like express the difficulty of like for Tesla to go from nothing to making a battery cell\\nthat we aspire to be better than any other battery cell in earth even when compared to companies where the only thing they do is\\nmake a battery cell is obviously not a trivial exercise. That said, we do see a path to high -- very high energy density and --\\nhigher energy density and lower cost than anything else out there. but it\\'s a hard path. It\\'s a very hard path. And normally, it\\nwould be absurd for companies to attempt such a thing. And no other car company is really attempting to do anything like this in\\na serious way.\\nSo I guess, technically, BYD because they started out as a battery company. But yes, so it\\'s a very difficult thing to do. But I think\\nwe are tracking to success in that regard.\\nUnknown Attendee\\nElon, first of all, thank you for undoubtedly making the world a better place for my son to live in. Once Cybertruck is fully ramped\\nin Austin, what is the target production? And also, there are some rumors that you\\'re thinking about stepping down as CEO.\\nPlease say it ain\\'t so.\\nElon R. Musk\\nIt ain\\'t so. Yes, so I think Tesla is going to play an important role in AI and AGI. And I think I need to oversee that to make sure\\nit\\'s good. So because that\\'s a thorny problem if there ever was one.\\nI think generally, people do not -- very few people, even in the AI community, do not appreciate just how much capability Tesla\\nhas in AI. It\\'s by far the most advanced real-world AI. There\\'s no 1 even close. And reality has the most degrees of freedom. So I\\ngot to make sure that\\'s good.\\nUnknown Attendee\\nCybertruck fully ramped, market production.\\nElon R. Musk\\nSo I said that we\\'ll start production later this year. We\\'ll start handing over cars later this year. There will be an S curve of\\nproduction, so it will be slow at first and then ramping up. And I guess we\\'ll see what the demand is like. So I mean I think there\\'s\\n-- we\\'re likely to do probably 0.25 million a year, I think, maybe more. Again, very much dependent on what the demand is like.\\nAnd we don\\'t just need to ramp up production, but we also needed to improve the production cost efficiency, which is going to be\\nalso a very hard thing.\\nSo but I\\'d say it\\'s 0.25 million a year is a reasonable guess. And it might be $500,000, I don\\'t know. But we\\'ll make as many as\\npeople want and kind of forward -- and but like I said, it\\'s going to be hard to make the cost affordable because it is a new car --\\nnew manufacturing method.\\nSo in the grand scheme of things relative to the production rate of all the other cars we make, it will be small, but still very cool.\\nUnknown Attendee\\nGood day, Mr. Musk. Hello, my name is Dillie Archer. And this question aims to address Tesla\\'s efforts in developing skilled\\nworkforce, attracting diverse talent and promoting career opportunities within the company. When I look around, I see a lot of\\nyoung faces, and I think about internships and apprenticeships for students in high school and beyond. My question is are there\\nTesla, Inc. | Event Detail\\nLicensed to martin.thomasmathews@ihsmarkit.com Powered by S&P Global | Page 16 of 20any plans to expand existing partnerships and explore new avenues for collaborations with educational institutions and nonprofit\\norganizations to attract the next generation and vary career pathways.\\nElon R. Musk\\nYes. Actually, with all of our Gigafactories, we work with the local schools actually from the high school level, community college\\nand university because it\\'s incredibly important to foster the talent for the factories. As you saw from the employment numbers,\\nwe actually need a lot of people. Even though we\\'ve got a lot of automation, we still need a lot of people to operate the factories,\\nand really matters that they have the right training. So we believe in reaching out to educational institutions. And because, frankly,\\nit\\'s in our interest to do so. So thank you for asking the question.\\nUnknown Attendee\\nElon, this is Josh Bhullar. I had originally thought of asking about the fund police and pushing back on the boom box and allowing\\nus to stretch our people with goats again. But after seeing Optimus, I was inspired to ask that does -- has anybody asked\\nOptimus\\' opinion of Mars and does he have a ticket yet?\\nElon R. Musk\\nWell, Optimus is not a deep thinker at this point. So Optimus is still figuring out how to do basic stuff. Like it couldn\\'t make --\\ncook some eggs or something quite yet. So we need to get Optimus to the point where it has reasonable agility and can do basic\\nthings. And we\\'re aiming for it to start off doing simple tasks that are sort of boring and repetitive, or simply dangerous. Basically\\njobs people don\\'t want to do. So that\\'s our goal. And I\\'m confident we\\'ll achieve that goal.\\nAnd then we\\'re going to figure out how to make it at scale, make sure that the robots -- the robot is safe. I think it\\'s going to be\\nvery important to have a local means of turning it off. So safety is going to be extremely important. I can\\'t say that enough, but\\nright now it is not at an intelligence level where it\\'s pondering questions like Mars. Perhaps it will be 1 day.\\nUnknown Attendee\\nElon, my name is Luke Arsenault. I just want to start off by saying a big thank you to you and the team of Tesla for all you guys\\ndo. It\\'s been great to see, and I\\'m so happy for you guys.\\nMy question is, with the rise in cybersecurity threats to operational technology and Internet of Things, what steps is Tesla taking\\nto protect the company itself and its products from these threats? Also, as a suggestion, because I know you like suggestions, for\\nthe navigation, do you think we could do something on the UI that adds in when you\\'re about to take the off-ramp to show a\\npicture of that exit, kind of like other map systems do?\\nElon R. Musk\\nMan, this is a lot of questions.\\nUnknown Attendee\\nOne of my friends wanted to get a selfie from you, if that\\'s possible.\\nElon R. Musk\\nOkay, well, we are constantly improving the navigation system. And I think robust to hacking is incredibly important. In fact, we\\nconduct a lot of sort of third-party hacking contests to try to get the best hackers in the world to break into our cars. And actually,\\nno one has yet actually broken into a Tesla in a way that would allow you to really control the car in a significant way, but they\\nhave gotten to where they can like honk the horn and mess with the infotainment system. And I\\'d like to thank them for their\\nefforts. So we take information security extremely seriously.\\nFor navigation, yes, there\\'s definitely things we can improve there. But really, down-the-road navigation visuals are not going to\\nmatter very much because the car is going to take you wherever you want to go.\\nAs for pictures, I have to decline, unfortunately, because otherwise, if I say -- I actually hate being rude to people. So if I say yes\\nto 1 person, then it\\'s like selfies for a zillion. It gets kind of crazy. But thanks for asking.\\nMaybe we\\'ll take 1 or 2 more questions actually.\\nTesla, Inc. | Event Detail\\nLicensed to martin.thomasmathews@ihsmarkit.com Powered by S&P Global | Page 17 of 20Unknown Attendee\\nI had a question on the efficiency. I don\\'t know if you\\'ve been paying attention to [indiscernible], and I was curious if you thought\\nthat was a space that you could see Tesla getting into as far as not just an efficient manufacturing process, but also the actual\\ncar itself in range. Or just buy.\\nElon R. Musk\\nI\\'m not super familiar with them, but we have a lot of products to get done. It\\'s not like -- this is -- it\\'s never a shortage of ideas.\\nIdeas, frankly, I find ideas to be somewhat trivial, but the execution of the idea is extremely difficult. And as I said, the prototypes\\nare easy, production is hard. Production and cash flow positive is excruciating pain like at a level you cannot believe. So it\\'s not\\nproduct ideas. They\\'re irrelevant, right? That\\'s why I think of them. It\\'s sort of like the idea of going to the moon. That\\'s irrelevant.\\nGetting to the moon is the hard part.\\nSo okay. So maybe 1 last question? Yes.\\nUnknown Attendee\\nJon Lopez from Orlando here. I\\'ve got 2 things for you real quick. The first one is, with rideshare being a growing thing,\\nespecially with Tesla owners. Are we going to get a guest mode option available for that? The second thing is as an X Plaid\\nowner, I would really love to get track mode.\\nElon R. Musk\\nPlaid has track mode.\\nUnknown Attendee\\nThe model X Plaid doesn\\'t have, though.\\nElon R. Musk\\nOh, model X. Yes, we can probably add that, sure. No problem.\\nSo rideshare is a bunch of these things will really not be relevant in a self-driving world. You can summon the car and take you\\nsomewhere, and if you want to add someone to that ride, you can if you want to. But overwhelmingly, it is about achieving\\nself-driving -- full self-driving. And I think we\\'re really getting to the final stages of full self-driving, where I mean, I drove for\\nseveral days around Austin, just dropping pins in random locations and had 0 safety interventions. So it\\'s really -- even in the city\\nof San Francisco, which is very complex, I haven\\'t had a safety intervention in a long time. So I think it\\'s really -- it\\'s getting to a\\npoint where admittedly, I have been optimistic about this in the past, but I think this time -- all right. I don\\'t want to say it. Fair\\nenough. Okay. I think it will happen.\\nUnknown Attendee\\nSo first, congratulations on your decision to try advertising. We all want Tesla to beat Apple in market cap.\\nElon R. Musk\\nI didn\\'t realize people wanted it that much.\\nUnknown Attendee\\nOkay. It\\'s good that a lot of people agree. So earlier this year, you cut prices on everything, 15%, 20%. More recently, you\\'ve\\nbeen raising prices on Model Y, Model S, Model X. And can you just talk about the pricing strategy of model Light going forward\\nand keep it separate from the decision to bring out the next-gen vehicles that we all agree is going to blow the doors off on\\nvolume? But just on Model Y, the best-selling product in the world. Can you just talk about strategy pricing going forward on that?\\nElon R. Musk\\nI mean it\\'s pretty straightforward. I mean, we see what the demand is and then we adjust pricing to meet the demand. Now the\\nthing is that what is -- what happens with other carmakers is that they\\'re actually constantly adjusting pricing on cars. It\\'s just not\\nobvious. In the case of Tesla, you can see immediately when there\\'s a price change that occurs because we don\\'t have any\\nintermediaries, we don\\'t have any dealers. There\\'s no manufacturers\\' adjusted retail price. But the reality is at car dealers, the\\nprices are changing radically.\\nTesla, Inc. | Event Detail\\nLicensed to martin.thomasmathews@ihsmarkit.com Powered by S&P Global | Page 18 of 20I mean, last year, there were significant premiums above MSRP at sort of the conventional car dealer like -- so you\\'d pay above\\nMSRP last year. And then this year, I think things are below MSRP or close to it. And then the manufacturers will then also offer\\nincentives. So what\\'s actually happening is our very big price shifts by other carmakers. They\\'re just not obvious. Whereas with\\nTesla, it\\'s obvious. So -- and this is necessary because demand fluctuates a lot. So something\\'s got to be done to achieve a\\nsupply-demand clearing point for volume. So just people are reacting to something that\\'s obvious as opposed to saying, oh, yes,\\nevery car company does this all the time, Tesla is no exception. That\\'s the actual reality.\\nUnknown Attendee\\nI\\'ll be really quick. So I will say I have been driving FSD, my wife drives FSD. There\\'s a term called the wife test. My wife will only\\ndrive our kids on FSD. It\\'s incredible.\\nElon R. Musk\\nThat is a great -- I mean, the sort of significant other tests are a very good test because for a while there, there was like friends\\nor significant others would be like, please don\\'t put it on. It\\'s too scary. But then I guess it\\'s getting to the point where -- I mean,\\nit\\'s going to be just smooth as silk. So in fact, you\\'ll be able to visually tell and perhaps even now you can visually tell if the car is\\nbeing driven on FSD or manually because if it\\'s being driven on FSD, it\\'s smooth and precise. And if you look at actual -- if you\\nactually closely observe cars going down the highway, people are constantly moving in their lanes. So the cars are like doing this\\nall the time when they\\'re manually driven.\\nIf it\\'s actually on FSD, it\\'s dead center in the lane. And it will actually get to the point where it is not merely -- and maybe is at\\nthat point, not merely safer than a person, but actually way smoother than manual driving.\\nI just -- really, I can\\'t say enough about the profundity of full self-driving. It is just 1 of the biggest changes in history that will\\noccur. It\\'s not some feature. It\\'s like a profound -- it\\'s really as profound as electrification and we have already have millions of\\nthe cars on the road that will literally achieve this with a software update. I mean that\\'s like head exposing emoji. And I think\\nprobably a lot of people in this room realize it, but the rest -- most of the rest of the world doesn\\'t.\\nUnknown Attendee\\nGiven how incredible FSD is and how much merit you\\'re giving to potential future margins of the car, as well as how much an\\nimpact on society, and given that they didn\\'t even want you to say if it\\'s going to happen this year, just not to jinx it, would it be\\npossible to have just for some type of public-facing investor-facing kind of timeline? So that way, you mentioned B12 is coming,\\nand that\\'s AI front end. Can we just see kind of a timeline on this is the version we\\'re at, these are the things we\\'re working on,\\nand this is 1 we have ETA. So we can kind of see that in real time instead of maybe Elon Time?\\nElon R. Musk\\nSo the thing that\\'s been really difficult with full self-driving is that it very often seems like it\\'s about to happen until you realize that\\nyou\\'re actually at a local maximum, and that you need to re-architect elements of the software to get out of the local maximum to\\nthen a higher local maximum. So it\\'s been a sort of series of logarithmic curves. And that\\'s why it\\'s been like it seemed like, oh, if\\nyou just extrapolate this on a straight line, it gets self-driving, except that it\\'s not a straight line. It\\'s a logarithmic curve. And it\\'s\\nsort of -- you start hitting these like local maximums where you\\'re sort of asset to a certain capability and then have to rearchitect\\nthings.\\nSo no, I think we\\'re finally at a high enough local maximum. But will be this year to the point where it is, I think, probably safer\\nthan a person meeting. The probability of injury on average will be better than a person, even if someone pays no attention to the\\ncar.\\nIt is worth saying that right now, for human-supervised Tesla\\'s full self-driving, it is dramatically safer than manual driving. It\\'s like\\nI think like 4x safer maybe more. So it is already a massive safety improvement to have human-supervised FSD right now. And I\\nthink we will get to the point where we\\'re always going to be in some amount of local maximum. But I think that will be in a local\\nmaximum that exceeds human level safety this year. Yes, but I guess we\\'ll see.\\nSo anyway, I want to thank you all for coming. And so -- just want to say, your support is super appreciated. As I say, a friend in\\nneed is a friend indeed and supporting Tesla when the chips are down, those are the real friends. And you\\'re them.
